        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Q: Difference between map, filter, forEach, find?</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">map: map creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array. It returns a new array with the same length as the original array. </p>
        <p class="mt-2">filter: filter creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a new array with only the elements that pass the test. </p>
        <p class="mt-2">forEach: forEach executes a provided function once for each array element. It does not return anything and only executes the callback function for each element.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">find: find returns the value of the first element that satisfies the provided function, otherwise, it returns undefined. </p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Q: Difference between localStorage, SessionStorage, Cookie?</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">localStorage: Data stored in localStorage is persistent and will remain even after the browser is closed or the computer is turned off.  </p>
        <p class="mt-2">sessionStorage:  sessionStorage is similar to localStorage, but the data stored in sessionStorage is only available for the duration of the current browser session.  </p>
        <p class="mt-2">Cookie: Cookies are small text files that are stored in a user's browser by a website. Cookies can be used to store user preferences, login information, and other data. Cookies can have an expiration date, after which they will be automatically deleted by the browser.</p>

        <h2 class="text-lg font-bold">Q: How the event loop Work?</h2>
        <p class="mt-2">The event loop is a mechanism that allows the JavaScript engine to handle asynchronous code by continuously checking for and executing tasks that are waiting in a queue. When an asynchronous task is started, it is added to the queue, and the JavaScript engine continues to execute the rest of the code. When the task is completed, a callback function is added to the queue to handle the result.</p>
